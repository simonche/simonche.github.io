## Contributing to OpenEP

OpenEP has been in continually development for the past 10 years during the course of the developers' active electrophysiology research. The OpenEP platform itself was available to selected collaborators throughout this time but was made available to the community at the end of 2020 with the first official release in February 2021. 

We hope that the open source nature of this platform will now support future collaborative developments in open electrophysiology data analysis and we encourage interested researchers, academcis and industry partners to contact [steven.williams@ed.ac.uk](mailto:steven.williams@.ed.ac.uk) to discuss collaborations.
