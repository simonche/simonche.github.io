team:
  - title: Steven Williams
    image: images/portrait-sw.png
    content: Steven is a BHF Intermediate Clinical Research Fellow in Cardiac Electrophysiology at the University of Edinburgh and an Honorary Senior Lecturer in the Division of Imaging Sciences & Biomedical Engineering at  King's College London. His research interests focus on the intersection of electrophysiology and cardiac imaging with insights from computational modelling.
  - title: Nick Linton
    image: images/portrait-nl.png
    content: Nick is Senior Lecturer in Cardiovascular Bioengineering at Imperial College London, combined with being a Consultant Cardiologist and Electrophysiologist at Imperial Healthcare. His research interests include mapping of complex arrhythmias and the development of predictive tools for arrhythmia.
  - title: Steve Niederer
    image: images/portrait-sn.png
    content: Steve is the head of the King’s College London Cardiac Electro-Mechanics Research Group  (CEMRG). The group focus on using physiology and physics encoded in biophysical models to interpret diagnostic and imaging data from the heart. The team works closely with cardiac imaging, cardiology, cardiovascular research and data science collaborators  to bring novel technologies to bear to study and treat cardiovascular diseases.
  - title: Adam Connolly
    image: images/portrait-ac.png
    content: Adam is a Data Scientist at Invicro UK where he develops deep neural networks for various biomedical and image processing tasks, alongside general software development work. Prior to this he was a research associate in computational cardiac electrophysiology at King's College London. Adam has a PhD in aerospace engineering from Imperial College London.
  - title: Caroline Roney
    image: images/portrait-cr.png
    content: Caroline is an MRC Skills Development Fellow working in the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King’s College London. She uses a combination of signal processing, machine learning and computational modelling techniques to develop novel methodologies for investigating atrial fibrillation mechanisms from clinical imaging data and electrical recordings.
  - title: Cesare Corrado
    image: images/portrait-cc.png
    content: Dr Cesare Corrado is a postdoctoral research associate in the School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences at King’s College London. His earlier research concerned computational models for multi-physics problems and data assimilation techniques (reverse engineering). Using computational models of the human heart, personalised from clinical data (MRI, Electrograms), he develops new methodologies to improve the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.
